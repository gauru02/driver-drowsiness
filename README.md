The aim of this project is to develop a simulation of drowsiness detection system. 
The focus will be placed on designing a system that will accurately monitor the 
open or closed state of the driverâ€™s eyes and mouth. By monitoring the eyes, it is 
believed that the symptoms of driver's drowsiness can be detected in sufficiently 
early stage, to avoid a car accident.
